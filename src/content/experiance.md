## Tech Journay

I have worked on a wide range of projects, ranging from simple websites to custom CRM systems. I have had the opportunity to work in both small teams and as a solo developer, effectively managing entire projects independently.

During my career, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of different CMS platforms and their respective strengths. ProcessWire has become my primary area of expertise, where I have developed a deep understanding of its capabilities and nuances. 

I have a strong passion towards front-end development and enjoy engaging in more creative work. However, throughout my professional journey, I have found myself gravitating towards the middle ground, embracing full-stack development using popular open-source platforms. I have the ability to work with any PHP-based CMS system, leveraging my proficiency in **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP**.
